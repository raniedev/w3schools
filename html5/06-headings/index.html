        The HTML <head> Element
        The HTML <head> element is a container for metadata. HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
    
        The <head> element is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag:
    -->
    <head>
        <!--
            Note: Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
        -->
        <title>Headings</title>
        <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- 
            HTML Headings
            Headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
            <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.
            
            Note: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.
        -->
        <h1>Heading 1</h1>
        <h2>Heading 2</h2>
        <h3>Heading 3</h3>
        <h1>Heading 4</h4>
        <h5>Heading 5</h5>
        <h6>Heading 6</h6>

        <!-- 
            Headings Are Important
            Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

            Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.
            <h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.

            Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.

            Bigger Headings
            Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:
        -->
        <h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>

        <!-- 
            HTML Horizontal Rules
            The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.

            The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
        -->
        <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
        <p>This is some text.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
        <p>This is some other text.</p>
        <hr>
