        <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
        <p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.</p>
        
        <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and describes the structure of a Web page, html consists of a series of elements, the elements tell the browser how to display the content and they are represented by tags.</p>
        <p>HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on
        Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page.</p>

        <!-- 
            HTML tags are element names surrounded by angle brackets:

            <tagname>content goes here...</tagname>

            HTML tags normally come in pairs like <p> and </p>
            The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag
            The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name
            Tip: The start tag is also called the opening tag, and the end tag the closing tag.


            Web Browsers
            The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them.
            The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document.
