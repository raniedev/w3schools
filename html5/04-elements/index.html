            HTML Elements
            An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and an end tag, with the content inserted in between:
        
            <tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
            The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
        
            <p>My first paragraph.</p> 

            Start tag               Element content             End tag
            <h1>	                My First Heading	        </h1>
            <p>	                    My first paragraph.	        </p>
            <br>

            HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag, such as the <br> element (which indicates a line break).

            Nested HTML Elements
            HTML elements can be nested (elements can contain elements).
            All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
                <body>
                   <h1>My First Heading</h1>
                    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
                </body>
            </html>

            Example Explained
            The <html> element defines the whole document.

            It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.
            Inside the <html> element is the <body> element.
            
            The <body> element defines the document body.
            It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>.
            Inside the <body> element is two other HTML elements: <h1> and <p>.

            The <h1> element defines a heading.
            It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>.
            The element content is: My First Heading.

            The <p> element defines a paragraph.
            It has a start tag <p> and an end tag </p>.
            The element content is: My first paragraph.
            
            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            
            Do Not Forget the End Tag
            Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag:
        -->
        <p>This is a paragraph
        <p>This is a paragraph
        
        <!--
            The example above works in all browsers, because the closing tag is considered optional.
            Never rely on this. It might produce unexpected results and/or errors if you forget the end tag.
            
            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Empty HTML Elements
            HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.

            <br> is an empty element without a closing tag (the <br> tag defines a line break):
        -->
        <p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break. A empty tag don't need a closing tag.</p>

        <!-- 
            Empty elements can be "closed" in the opening tag like this: <br />.

            HTML5 does not require empty elements to be closed. But if you want stricter validation, or if you need to make your document readable by XML parsers, you must close all HTML elements properly.

            HTML Is Not Case Sensitive
            HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.

            The HTML5 standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.

            At W3Schools we always use lowercase tags.
