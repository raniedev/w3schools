        <h2>Relative File Paths</h2>
        <p>A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page.</p>
        <p>In this example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located at the root of the current web:</p>
        <h3>src="/images/paris.jpg"</h3>
        <img src="/images/paris.jpg" alt="Paris city">
        <p><i><b>Obs.:</b> It's work in web only.</i></p>
        
        <p>In this example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the current folder:</p>
        <h3>src="images/rio-de-janeiro.jpg"</h3>
        <img src="images/rio-de-janeiro.jpg" alt="Rio de Janeiro city">

        <p>In this example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the current folder:</p>
        <h3>src="new-york.jpg"</h3>
        <img src="new-york.jpg" alt="New York city"><br>

        <p>In this example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the folder one level above the current folder:</p>
        <h3>src="../tokyo.jpg"</h3>
        <img src="../tokyo.jpg" alt="Tokyo city">

        <h2>Best Practice</h2>
        <p>It is best practice to use relative file paths (if possible).</p>
        <p>When using relative file paths, your web pages will not be bound to your current base URL. All links will work on your own computer (localhost) as well as on your current public domain and your future public domains.</p>
