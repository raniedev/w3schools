            HTML Paragraphs
            The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph:
            
            Note: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
        -->
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is another paragraph.</p>

        <!-- 
            HTML Display
            You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
            Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
            With HTML, you cannot change the output by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.

            The browser will remove any extra spaces and extra lines when the page is displayed:
        -->
        <p>
        This paragraph
        contains a lot of lines
        in the source code,
        but the browser
        ignores it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        This paragraph
        contains         a lot of spaces
        in the source         code,
        but the        browser
        ignores it.
        </p>

        <!-- 
            Don't Forget the End Tag
            Most browsers will display HTML correctly even if you forget the end tag:
        -->
        <p>This is a paragraph.
        <p>This is another paragraph.
        
        <!--
            The example above will work in most browsers, but do not rely on it.
            Note: Dropping the end tag can produce unexpected results or errors.

            HTML Line Breaks
            The HTML <br> element defines a line break.

            Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:
        -->
        <p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
        <!-- 
            The <br> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.

            The Poem Problem
            This poem will display on a single line:

        <p>
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
            
            My Bonnie lies over the sea.
            
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
            
            Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.

            The HTML <pre> Element
            The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
        
            The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
        -->
        <pre>
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
            
            My Bonnie lies over the sea.
            
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
            
            Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
        </pre>
